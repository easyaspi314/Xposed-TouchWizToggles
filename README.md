# Xposed-TouchWizToggles
Allows you to reorder the notification toggles and enable some hidden ones on Samsung pre-4.2 TouchWiz devices (Only tested on the S II Skyrocket on 4.1.2)

####NOTICE
This does not work on non-TouchWiz devices or on 4.2+ vanilla quick toggles, although I haven't tested that on a 4.2+ or 4.0- TW device.

#####TODO
* Configuration setup.
* I would love to put a friendly edit button on the end of the list, but the code keeps removing it.
* Need testers. I know this code does not work on AOSP, the classes do not exist there, and 99% likely other OEM/custom ROMS and 4.2+
